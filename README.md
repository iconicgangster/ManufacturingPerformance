Case Study Premise:
Efficient production performance is crucial for any manufacturing company to meet client demands, optimize resources, and maximize profitability. This study addresses these needs by offering detailed insights into production performance across multiple dimensions.
The Manufacturing Performance Report provides the management team with tools to:
•	Monitor and evaluate key production indicators,
•	Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and
•	Make data-driven decisions to enhance operational effectiveness.
What we are doing in case study :
•	To analyze and provide insights into production performance categorized by product, time periods, and operational sequences, highlighting inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization.
•	identifying production inefficiencies to improve resource utilization and reduce costs.
•	bottleneck analysis (process optimization) and cost analysis (planned vs. actual)
What two topics we are going to implement :
Minimize Production Costs using Solver:
•	Use PlannedCost and ActualCost from the Work Order Routing Sheet.
•	Adjust resources or production allocation to reduce costs while meeting production targets.
•	Improve Resource Utilization:Focus on optimizing the allocation of OrderQty to reduce waste or maximize efficiency.
•	Introduce constraints like available resources or demand fulfillment.
Regression Analysis :
1. Predicting Production Efficiency (Product Sheet)
•	Dependent Variable: Production Efficiency (%).
•	Independent Variables: OrderQty, StockedQty, ScrappedQty
2. Analyzing Delays (Work Order Routing Sheet)
•	Dependent Variable: Delay (in seconds).
•	Independent Variables: Cost Variance, OperationSequence, LocationID (as categorical variables).
